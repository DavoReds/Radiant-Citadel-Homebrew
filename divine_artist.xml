			<p>At 3rd level, you can draw the likeness of a creature and animate it to fight for you. While you are using your calligrapher's or painter's supplies as a spellcasting focus, as an action, you can expend a spell slot to quickly sketch the outline of and animate a creature you have seen before in an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of you. You can animate one creature with a challenge rating equal to or less your artificer level divided by 4, rounded down. The spell slot you expend depends on the challenge rating of the creature you animate, as shown in the Divine Art table.</p>

            <p class="indent">The creature is also considered a construct, and disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, if it is reduced to 0 hit points, or you lose your concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The creature can't cast any spells, or inflict any diseases, and if the creature has any legendary or lair actions, they can't be used. The drawn creature is friendly to you and your companions. Roll for initiative for the drawn creature, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal command that you issue them (no action required by you).</p>
            <p class="indent">If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>
